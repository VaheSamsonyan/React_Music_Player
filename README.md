# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Usage

This project allows users to easily manage and listen to a list of songs. Follow the steps below to utilize its features:

### Searching for Songs

1. Open the application and navigate to the SongList section.
2. Use the "Search tracks" input box to search for specific songs by typing the song name.
3. The list will dynamically update based on your search query, allowing you to quickly find the desired song.

### Uploading Songs

1. Click on the "Choose file" button to open a file dialog.
2. Select either an MP3 or WAV file from your local storage.
3. The selected file will be displayed, and you can listen to it using the default player provided.
4. To add the song to the list, click the "Upload" button. The song details will be added to the list.

### Simulated Actions

- **Play All Button**: Simulates playing all songs in the list.
- **Add All Button**: Simulates adding all songs to a playlist.
- **Track Number Button**: Simulates sorting the songs based on track numbers.

### Listening to Songs

- You can listen to any song in the list by using the default player provided for each song row.
- Click the play/pause button to control the playback.

### Note

- The "Filter" input is not functional, but you can effectively use the "Search tracks" input for a similar purpose.
- Feel free to explore and interact with the features to manage your music library efficiently.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
